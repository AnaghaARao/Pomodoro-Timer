# Pomodoro-Timer
A Pomodoro Timer Application with Three Modes using Vanilla JavaScript:

This Pomodoro Timer application built with Vanilla JavaScript offers users three distinct modes for optimal productivity. 
The focus mode, set at 25 minutes, helps users concentrate on their tasks. 
After the focus session, a short 5-minute break encourages a quick recharge, while a 15-minute long break follows every four focus sessions. 
The timer provides a clear visual countdown representation, allowing users to monitor their progress easily. 
This simple yet effective tool empowers users to manage their work and break intervals effectively.
